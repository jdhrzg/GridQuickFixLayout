# GridQuickFixLayout

Download, install, and rate my extension on the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=JerodHerzog.GridQuickFixLayout).

When working with XAML you'll use Grids everywhere.  Their rows and columns are not very flexible to change (see manual update gif below).  Despite these facts Visual Studio doesn't give you any help when working with them.

This extension fills some of that tooling gap; improving the speed and accuracy of your Grid layout changes.

Manually updating rows or columns after a layout change is very tedious...

So, instead of manually updating all of those rows you can use this extension to do it for you...
![IncrementRow](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/23ca34f3-7986-4404-970d-dac77b5b6765)

With this extension you can increment or decrement any number of rows or columns in your Grid quickly.  There is also a "Fill In Sequence" option that is slightly more "smart"...
